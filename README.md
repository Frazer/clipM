ClipMenu is a macOS clipboard manager rebuilt in Swift (SwiftUI + SwiftData).

## Installation

- **Mac App Store** (when published): search for ClipMenu, or install from your listing.
- **Direct download**: get the latest **ClipMenu-*.dmg** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Frazer/ClipMenu/releases/latest)

Open the DMG and drag `ClipMenu.app` into Applications.

App Store installs update through the App Store. Direct downloads update in-app via Sparkle (**Preferences → About**).

## What Is Updated From The Original

This repository now reflects a fully modernized implementation of ClipMenu. Major updates include:

- Replaced legacy polling-style clipboard handling with an event-driven clipboard pipeline.
- Adopted Combine-based publishers/observation in the app flow for reactive updates.
- Migrated persistence to SwiftData models and services.
- Completed end-to-end implementation of the Actions menu, including action execution wiring in the modern app.
- Rebuilt the app architecture in Swift with SwiftUI scenes and a generated Xcode project workflow.

### Actions shortcut

In **Preferences → Actions**, choose a modifier key (default **Command**). Hold that key while selecting a clip or snippet to open the action menu. If only one action is available, it runs immediately instead of showing the menu.

## Huge Thanks

A huge thank you to Naotaka Morimoto, the original author of ClipMenu.

ClipMenu has helped many users for years, and this modernization work stands on top of that original design and effort.

```sh
xcode-select -p
brew install xcodegen
```

Generate project:

```sh
xcodegen generate
```

Build (Debug, direct / GitHub):

```sh
xcodebuild -project ClipMenu.xcodeproj -scheme ClipMenu -configuration Debug build \
	CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

Build (Debug, App Store channel):

```sh
xcodebuild -project ClipMenu.xcodeproj -scheme ClipMenuAppStore -configuration Debug build \
	CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

For schemes, Sparkle keys, and release notes, see `BUILD.md`.

## Testing

UI smoke scripts for previews and `/` filter (plus the in-process filter self-test) are documented in [`doc/testing.md`](doc/testing.md).

## Repository Cleanup Status

- Legacy Objective-C source and historical release tooling were removed after migration.
- Direct downloads are published via **GitHub Releases** (DMG + Sparkle `appcast.xml`), not files under `dist/` on `master`.
- See `BUILD.md` for the release script and Actions workflow.
